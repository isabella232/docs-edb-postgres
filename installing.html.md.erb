##<a id='create'></a> Create a EDB Postgres Database in Apps Manager

After installing the EDB Postgres Service Broker tile, EDB Postgres appears as a service in the Marketplace of your deployment. Developers can provision PostgreSQL databases by creating service instances using Apps Manager or the cf Command Line Interface (CLI).

Follow the instructions below to create a EDB Postgres service instance using Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to Apps Manager in a browser and log in.
1. Click **Marketplace**.

1. Click **EDB Postgres**.

	<%= image_tag("add-plan.png") %>

1. Click **Select this plan**. You can also navigate to the documentation at the EnterpriseDB website by clicking **Docs**, and sign in to the EDB Customer Portal by clicking **Support**.

1. In the **Configure Instance** form, enter an **Instance Name** to identify the service instance in the deployment and click **Add**.

1. After you have created your service instance, you can bind it to an application. For more information on binding services instances, see [Managing Apps and Service Instances Using the Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html).
	<br><br>
	Binding a service instance to an application triggers credentials to be provisioned for the service instance and delivered to the application runtime in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. To view these credentials, navigate to an application with a bound service instance in Apps Manager and click **Env Variables**. The credentials provided to the EDB Postgres Service Broker tile have the following format:
	<br><br>
	```
	"credentials": {       
	"uri":"postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT/DATABASE"
	}
	```
